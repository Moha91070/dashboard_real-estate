This project aims to provide a web application using Streamlit to visualize real estate data, specifically focusing on property values and trends in the Île-de-France region of France.

## Purpose

This project was developed to analyze and visualize real estate data as part of my coursework at Efrei Paris. The goal is to provide insights into property values and trends, enabling users to explore and gain a better understanding of the real estate market in the Île-de-France region. If you have any questions or suggestions for improving the project, please feel free to reach out.
